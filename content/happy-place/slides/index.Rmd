# How to find your happy place in the world of R package development

---

## Why contribute to open-source?

* Enjoy it?

* Giving back?

* Skill development?

* Exposure?

---

## R package development?

There are other ways to contribute including community building.

This slidedeck focuses on R package development. :wink:

---

## Find your happy place

Especially is open-source work happens in your free time.

Right amount of time, right task fit.

```

---

## Your package(s)

* Ownership can be great! Your rules, your name.

* Beware of burn-out


---

## Your package(s)

```{=html}
{{< figure src="babies.JPG" alt="Sculpture of a man attacked by angry babies" caption="Vigeland installation, Frogner Park, Oslo" width=300 >}}
```

---

## Your package(s)

Interactions with users and contributors!

Both rewarding and time-consuming

---

## Make your repo a friendly place

* Contributing guide (what are your expectations?)

* Code of Conduct

* Governance file?

---

## Others' packages?

* A way for you to start

* A way for you to concentrate on your strengths

* What you actually want to do!

---

## Others' packages

* First watch development and interactions, read contributing guide.

* Start interacting in the repo.

---

## Others' packages

What packages? Packages...

* ... that you use

* ... corresponding to your skillset or skills you want to learn

* ... that have room for external contributions

* ... where your work is valued!

## Others' packages

Now often your name won't be on it, maybe only in the changelog.

How to still display your skills? Blogging, talks?

## Disclaimer

This was a very brief presentation, and a complex topic.
